## Why PocketGE is different from other OSRS GE trackers

Every other GE tool shows you the raw live margin or a simple historical average. PocketGE adds an **execution layer**:

- **EV-based target prices** — Target Buy / Target Sell aren't a percentile guess. They maximize *expected captured margin* = `P(offer fills) × (margin after 2% GE tax)`. P(fill) is built from a recency- and volume-weighted distribution of the actual recent tape. Too-low bids have fat margins but fill near-zero; too-high bids fill instantly but earn nothing. The product peaks at the realistic sweet spot.
- **2% Grand Exchange sales tax built in** (capped at 5,000,000 gp per item) so the displayed profit is what you actually keep, not a pre-tax illusion.
- **5-day breakout scanner** — sidebar lists items currently testing their true 5-day high or low, built from rolling 1-hour volume-weighted candles. Bounded candidate pool so it never floods the OSRS Wiki API.
- **Volume-split margin lists** — High Vol Margins (100,000+ daily volume staples: gems, ores, bars, arrows, runes) vs. Low Vol Margins (slower-moving items with wider spreads), so you don't tie up capital in a slow item expecting a fast flip.
- **Bank of Gielinor portfolio tracker** with per-stack ±% PnL alerts.
- **Notification Center** with master toggle, test-fire button, and inline per-stack threshold editing — shows you exactly what alerts are armed.
- **Mobile-first PWA** — installable to your phone's home screen, service worker so it loads instantly, designed for tapping at a GE clerk rather than dragging a mouse.
